# Moon Base Defense

**Moon Base Defense** is a work-in-progress game where you build and defend a moon base from enemy attacks. The game is being developed using the [Kaplay JS Engine](https://kaplayjs.org/) and features base-building, resource management, and strategic defense mechanics.

## Game play
- 🌕 Build and expand your moon base  
- 🏗️ Manage resources and infrastructure  
- 🚀 Defend against enemy attacks  
- 🔧 Upgrade and optimize your defenses  

## Status
This project is in early development and is not yet a complete game. 
I made all the sprites in here, I am not a skilled artist, I used [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) to make the sprites in browser.


## Inspiration
The game [Battlezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_(1998_video_game)) and defending your recycler and setting up turrets and such. I wanted to play this game but wanted a web version.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository
2. Use vscode to go live and serve the files to your browser (Chrome, etc.)
